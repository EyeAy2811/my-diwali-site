              The religious significance of Diwali varies regionally within India. One tradition links the festival to legends in the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Diwali is the day Rama, Sita, Lakshman and Hanuman reached Ayodhya after a period of 14 years in exile after Rama's army of good defeated demon king Ravana's army of evil.<br><br>
              As per another popular tradition, in the Dvapara Yuga period, Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, killed the demon Narakasura, who was the evil king of Pragjyotishapura, near present-day Assam, and released 16000 girls held captive by Narakasura. Diwali was celebrated as a signifier of triumph of good over evil after Krishna's Victory over Narakasura. The day before Diwali is remembered as Naraka Chaturdasi, the day on which Narakasura was killed by Krishna.<br><br>
              Many Hindus associate the festival with Goddess Lakshmi. Hindus of eastern India associate the festival with the Goddess Kali, who symbolises the victory of good over evil. Hindus from the Braj region in northern India, parts of Assam, as well as southern Tamil and Telugu communities view Diwali as the day the god Krishna overcame and destroyed the evil demon king Narakasura, in yet another symbolic victory of knowledge and good over ignorance and evil.  In western states such as Gujarat, and certain northern Hindu communities of India, the festival of Diwali signifies the start of a new year.<br><br>
              Mythical tales shared on Diwali vary widely depending on region and even within Hindu tradition, yet all share a common focus on righteousness, self-inquiry and the importance of knowledge

              In the lead-up to Deepavali, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with diyas and rangolis. During Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with saaki, diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth,[a] light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared. Originally a Hindu festival, Diwali is now also celebrated by Jains and Sikhs. It is a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh, and Jain diaspora.<br><br>
              The five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts. The common celebratory practices are common as festival of light, however there are minor differences from state to state in India. Diwali/Deepavali is usually celebrated twenty days after the Vijayadashami festival.<br><br>
              Some other faiths in India also celebrate their respective festivals alongside Diwali.The main day of the festival of Diwali (the day of Lakshmi Puja) is an official holiday in Fiji, Guyana,  India, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore,  Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.
